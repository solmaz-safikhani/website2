            <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="p1">Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 7,000 species,[1] ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group is paraphyletic since it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia, although some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.</p>
               <p class="p2"> Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Some lineages (known as "legless lizards"), have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some lizards, such as the forest-dwelling Draco, are able to glide. They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with bright colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.

            <h3 class="h3">The main five groups of lizards are:</h3>
            
            <ol class="ol">
                <li><strong>Anguimorpha:</strong>A rather eclectic group that contains glass lizards, beaded lizards, crocodile lizards, alligator lizards, legless lizards, slow worms, knob-scaled lizards, galliwasps, and, oddly enough, varanids, better known as monitor lizards.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Gekkota:</strong>This group contains every single species of gecko, including those with eyelids. Most geckos are small in size, ranging from a mere half-inch long to around 20 inches. More than 60% of all species have sticky pads on their feet, making them agile climbers.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Iguania:</strong>Another sort of “catch-all” group that contains iguanas, chameleons, chuckwallas, helmet lizards, agamids or “dragon lizards,” collared lizards, and anoles.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Lacertoidea:</strong>Generally referred to as “true” lizards for how common most species are throughout Europe. However, with more species being discovered, they have been found to have a surprisingly wide distribution across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. This group contains lacertas and wall lizards, tegus, whiptails, spectacled lizards, and worm lizards.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Scincomorpha:</strong>This group contains all species of skinks as well as girdled lizards, plated lizards, and night lizards.</li>
